## Regression Analysis: the effects of non-cognitive ability on labor force earnings in China

### Description:
This project is a data analysis written to analyze "the Impact of Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Abilities on Workers' Earnings", and mostly for Economic research assistance. Every part of this project is code for every year which shows how to do the following:
* Data cleaning: Exclude missing values and discrepancies with actual data
* Variables decomposing: Deformate and decompose the variables according to actual analytical needs
* Linear regression: Select regression variables and develop the basic linear regression model
* Treatment effects model: Build economics model in code form and obtain results
* Robustness testing: Reshaping and replacing variables for robustness testing

The raw data is revealed on a two-year basis, so the code is also a two-year interval.

### Installation:
* This is a Stata project, please note that the code can only be run on the [Stata Terminal](https://www.stata.com/). Be sure your Stata Terminal is version 15.1 or newer.


### Notice:
* Due to the limitations of CFPS data dissemination, I cannot upload the code's initial data along with it.
* Since this is a research submitted in Chinese, you may find some Chinese comments in the code.
